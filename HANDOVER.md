# Heron AI — Session Handover

**Written 2026-08-28, at the end of the second working session — the one that finished Phase 0.**
For whoever picks this up next: a fresh Claude session, a person, or the owner on his phone.

> ## ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST — you are probably on a machine with no Revit
>
> The owner is continuing this work **from mobile**, in Claude Code. **There is no Revit there**, and
> there is no Windows, so **nothing in this repository that touches Revit can be tested.**
>
> That does not mean stop. It means **be honest about which half you are in**, and mark every piece of
> Revit-side work as untested until it has met a real Revit on the owner's own machine.
>
> **What still works away from Revit:** [§5](#5-what-you-can-and-cannot-do-without-revit).
> **What must be re-tested on return:** [§6](#6-the-return-to-the-machine-checklist) — keep it up to date.

Then read [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) for the map and
[docs/27-build-order.md](docs/27-build-order.md) for what to build.

## 1. Where the project stands, in one paragraph

**Phase 0 is complete.** Steps 1 to 5 of 6 are built and **proven in real Revit 2020 and 2024**: the
bridge, the thread hop onto Revit's own thread, a working MCP server inside Claude Code, *"select all
ducts"* with an audit trail, and one-chat-one-Revit binding that fails closed. The repository is
**private**.

**Step 6 — the first write — is BUILT AND UNPROVEN, and the gap between those two words is the whole
story of this section.** It was written on a phone, on a machine with no Revit, no Windows and no .NET
SDK. The add-in half has never been compiled, never loaded and has never moved anything. The chat half
is tested and passing. Do not read "Step 6 is built" as "Step 6 works".

**Heron can no longer be read-only by construction, so it is read-only by default instead.** That is a
real weakening and it was made deliberately: until 2026-08-27 there was no transaction code in the
repository at all, and the guarantee needed no trust. Now there is, and the guarantee rests on
`write.enabled` defaulting to `false` in `HeronPermissions`. **Leave it false until the write path has
been through a real Revit.** [§6](#6-the-return-to-the-machine-checklist) is how that happens.

---

## 2. What exists

```
revit/          Part 1 — loads into Revit.exe. C#. Changing it needs a Revit RESTART
  Heron.Revit.Addin/   ribbon toggle, icons, the ExternalEvent dispatcher, the operations
  Heron.Bridge/        named-pipe server, per-session token. No Revit reference
mcp/            Part 2 — the bridge to the AI host. Python, outside Revit
  client/              discovery, retries, doctor. Dependency-free on purpose
  server/              the MCP server and the session binding
brain/          Part 3 — knowledge. EMPTY BY DESIGN until Phase 2
platform/       Part 4 — the Kernel
  Heron.Core/          HeronPaths, HeronConfig, HeronIdentity, HeronAudit
tests/          two suites, both runnable WITHOUT Revit
tools/          scripts that keep the repo honest, plus setup and deploy
docs/           40 documents — specification, decisions, questions, roadmap
.claude/        skills and agents that ship with the repo
```

Each part has a `README.md` saying what belongs there and **when to fix things there**.

---

## 3. What is proven, and what is only built

**This distinction matters more than anything else in this document**, and it matters more than ever
now that the next stretch of work happens where Revit cannot be reached.

### Proven against a real Revit

| | |
|---|---|
| The bridge answers `ping` | Revit 2020 and 2024 |
| One button connects **and** disconnects; the icon shows which | Toggled repeatedly, every transition logged |
| Per-session token, minted per connect | 2024's token on the 2020 pipe → `unauthorized` |
| Newest connection wins — **the pipe only, since Step 6** | *"A newer connection took the session"*, older one dropped. Still true of the transport; a lease now decides who may actually send anything ([D-22](docs/DECISIONS.md)). **The lease itself is unproven** |
| Two Revits at once, separate pipes | `heron.2024.*` and `heron.2020.*` together |
| **The thread hop** | `5,844 elements` from 2024, `3,167` from 2020 |
| **"Revit is busy" instead of a hang** | Dialog open → clean refusal after 10s, recovers by itself |
| **The MCP server inside Claude Code** | Answered from both live Revits, no command run |
| **"Select all ducts"** | 4 found and **highlighted on screen**, confirmed by eye |
| The audit trail | Every request recorded — op, outcome, document, timing |
| **Fails closed when the chosen Revit closes** | 2024 closed with 2020 open → Heron **stopped** |
| `setup.ps1` end to end | Detects, builds, deploys all three in one run |
| Installer skips only the **open** release | 2020 and 2024 open → both skipped by name, 2027 installed |
| Each build carries the right runtime | `net472` / `net48` / `net10.0-windows`, read from the deployed DLLs |

### Built, never met a real Revit

| | |
|---|---|
| **Revit 2027** | Builds and installs. Never launched — the owner says his 2027 does not work |
| **Naming the session in a selection answer** | Fixed after both models turned out to be called `Project1`. Needs a Claude restart to go live, then one look |
| **Anything committed from mobile after 2026-08-28** | **Assume untested.** Add it to [§6](#6-the-return-to-the-machine-checklist) |
| **The whole of Step 6** | Never compiled. No .NET SDK on the machine it was written on, so not even the compiler has read it |
| `RevitWrite.cs` — preview, re-count, TransactionGroup, rollback | The one file that can change a model. Every claim in it is unverified |
| `HeronUnits`, `HeronPermissions`, `HeronStop` | Kernel C#. Plain arithmetic and flags, but still never compiled |
| The Emergency Stop ribbon button | New `PushButtonData` in a file whose ribbon currently works. **If Heron will not load after this, look here first** |
| **The lease** (`HeronLease`) | Refuses a second chat instead of cutting the first off. Changes behaviour proven in Step 1, and needs two chats and one Revit to test at all |
| **Bridge protocol 2** | A request now carries a `client` id. An add-in still on protocol 1 will refuse to talk — which is correct, and means the add-in MUST be rebuilt and redeployed |
| `revit_preview_move`, `revit_apply_move`, `revit_use_this_model` | The three new MCP tools. Never seen by a running host |

> The chat side of Step 6 **is** tested and passing — distance parsing, document pinning, single-use
> approval: `python tests/test_write_safety.py`, 38 checks. That test says nothing whatsoever about the
> transaction, the rollback or the move, and says so itself.

### Does not exist at all

| | |
|---|---|
| **Any write to a model** | Step 6. There is no transaction code in the repository |
| **The brain** | `brain/` is empty by design until Phase 2 |

> Nothing here is known-broken. Several things are **untested**, which is different and more honest.

## 4. The things that will bite you

Each of these cost real time. They are in the order they were learned.

1. **The Revit API can only be called from Revit's own thread, inside an API context.** An MCP server is
   a separate process and cannot call it at all. Everything marshals through one `ExternalEvent`.
   [docs/03 §4](docs/03-heron-revit.md)

2. **A named pipe needs `CreateNewInstance`, not just `ReadWrite`.** Without it only the *first*
   listener can be created and every retry fails with "access denied".

3. **The discovery file must never carry the document name.** Storing it produced the stale-name trap in
   the owner's earlier work. [docs/25 §2a](docs/25-multi-session-and-binding.md)

4. **"No reply" does not mean "dead".** Test the *process*, not the reply — and check it is still the
   right *program*, because Windows reuses process ids.

5. **An assumption is not a choice.** If one Revit was open, Heron *assumed* it. If the user answered,
   they *chose*. Conflate the two and a second Revit opening mid-chat silently sends everything to the
   first one. [docs/25](docs/25-multi-session-and-binding.md), and `tests/test_session_binding.py`.

6. **Naming the document is not always enough.** Two sessions can both have `Project1` open — it
   happened. Name the session too.

7. **Two waits, not one.** *"Did Revit pick it up?"* and *"having started, did it finish?"* are
   different questions. Collapsing them tells the user Revit is busy while it is actually working.

8. **Retry only what never left the machine.** A failed connect can always be retried. A **lost answer**
   cannot — Step 6 writes must pass `idempotent=False` or a move happens twice.

9. **`Platform=x64` puts build output in `bin/x64/$Configuration`.** Scripts should *find* the
   assembly, not assume the path shape.

10. **An empty array passed to a PowerShell parameter arrives as `$null`**, and `@($null)` has one
    element. This turned "no Revit open" into "one Revit open" and blocked every install.

---

## 5. What you can and cannot do without Revit

### Works anywhere, including mobile

```bash
python tools/check-docs.py             # links, Golden Rule / decision / question references
python tools/check-metadata.py         # the standard, registry vs code, and version agreement
python tools/check-structure.py        # layout, layering, adapter boundary, path ownership
python tests/test_bridge_roundtrip.py  # the bridge end to end — Windows, but NO Revit
python tests/test_session_binding.py   # one chat one Revit, all four cases — pure Python
python tests/test_write_safety.py      # Step 6's CHAT half — distances, pinning, approval
python tests/test_failure_analysis.py  # never blind-retries, and fails closed
python tests/test_tool_registry.py     # both languages agree on what may write
python tests/test_config_and_health.py # settings agree; health means something
```

- **All documentation, decisions, specifications and open questions.**
- **The session binding**, in full. Its test fakes the world and exercises the real logic.
- **Reading and reasoning about the C#.** Just not running it.

### Cannot be done without Revit — and cannot be faked

- Anything that loads into `Revit.exe`: the ribbon, the icons, the dispatcher, the operations.
- `tools/setup.ps1` and `tools/deploy-addin.ps1` — they need Revit installed, and Windows.
- `test_bridge_roundtrip.py` needs **Windows named pipes**, so it will not run on a phone either.
- Every claim in [§3](#3-what-is-proven-and-what-is-only-built) marked *proven against a real Revit*.

> **If you change C# from mobile, you cannot know it works.** Say so in the commit message, and add it
> to the checklist below. A commit that reads as though it were tested is worse than one that admits it
> was not.

---

## 6. The return-to-the-machine checklist

**The list lives in [`NEEDS-CHECKING.md`](NEEDS-CHECKING.md), not here.**

Every item is unproven, every item has an ID (`A1`, `D3`) so it can be named in a message without
being described again, and they are in dependency order — nothing in group D can be attempted before
group A passes.

It is kept as ONE register rather than a copy in each file, because two lists of the same thing drift
and this repository has been bitten by that more than once. Add to it every time something is built
away from Revit; delete an item only when it has actually passed.

**The single most important line in it is `D3`:** move the ducts 200 mm, then *measure one*. That is
what catches a unit error, and a unit error is the failure that looks fine until somebody measures it
months later.

The one-command path back to a working machine:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\setup.ps1
```

It checks Python first, detects installed Revit versions, refuses only the ones that are **open**, and
deploys per-user with no administrator rights. Then start Revit → **Heron AI** tab → **Heron** (click to
connect, again to disconnect), and:

```bash
python mcp/client/heron_bridge_client.py ping
python mcp/client/heron_bridge_client.py count
```

Anything wrong → `python mcp/client/heron_bridge_client.py doctor` prints everything needed to diagnose it.

**For unattended testing**, set `bridge.autoConnect = true` in `%APPDATA%\Heron\config\heron.config`
and the bridge starts without a button press. Default is `false` on purpose — a Revit that was never
connected being invisible is a safety property. **Put it back afterwards.**

---

## 7. The decisions you must not quietly undo

> ### ⛔ Heron is the only codebase you write to
>
> **The owner's instruction, 2026-08-28.** There are two other repositories on this machine — an existing
> Revit add-in and a knowledge package. Both are **reference only**:
>
> - **Never commit to them, never open a pull request on them, never update or upgrade them.** Every
>   change goes to Heron. *(A commit and a draft PR were made to the knowledge package on 2026-08-28
>   before this was said; both were withdrawn.)*
> - **Read them freely** — they solve overlapping problems and their scars are worth more than their
>   features. [PROPOSALS Part E](docs/PROPOSALS.md) is what that study produced.
> - **Never copy code or text out of them.** Understand the mechanism, then write it for Heron, in
>   Heron's shape, with Heron's reasoning. His words: *"study and use and make it part of our heron,
>   blindly copy paste dont do it."*
> - **Do not cite them as Heron's authority.** He stops using both once Heron is finished, so a note
>   whose argument is *"go read that other repository"* becomes worthless on that day. State the
>   reasoning here, in full, so it stands on its own.

Twenty-two are in [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). These are the load-bearing ones:

| | |
|---|---|
| **D-01** | Heron runs as a **Claude Code plugin** |
| **D-02** | **Named pipes**, per-PID. Local-only by construction — the add-in has *no network code at all* |
| **D-05** | **Revit 2020 → latest.** Never extrapolate the runtime table forward; an unlisted release is a build error |
| **D-06** | **C# for Revit, Python for everything outside it.** Settled again on evidence in [Q-39](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) |
| **D-09** | One `ExternalEvent`, one queue, one handler |
| **D-15** | **Where the field notes disagree with a specification, the field notes win.** Observed beats designed |
| **D-17** | Runtime state is machine-local; user data roams; the audit log stays with the data because it is evidence |
| **D-18** | The Transaction Agent belongs to **Step 6**, not Step 2 — a write path built before its rails ships without them |
| **D-19** | **Writing is off by default** until the write path has met a real Revit. Read-only stopped being structural the moment Step 6 existed; this is what replaced it |
| **D-20** | Millimetres to feet is **arithmetic, not `UnitUtils`** — exact, and nothing for Autodesk to move under it across 2020–2027 |
| **D-21** | Failure analysis is a **table, not a model call** — Heron's failures are its own bounded set of codes |
| **D-22** | A second chat is **refused, not allowed to take over**. *"Newest connection wins"* now describes the pipe only |

**Golden Rules** — **21, all official** — are in [docs/14](docs/14-golden-rules.md). 16–21 cover undo,
preview-before-modify, sandboxing, permission escalation, document pinning and stale reads, and were
**accepted on 2026-08-28** ([Q-19](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md)) *while Step 6 remained unproven*. That order
was deliberate: a rule that only binds once the code passes is not a rule the code was ever held to.
**They are exactly what Step 6 builds.**

---

## 8. What is waiting on the owner

| | |
|---|---|
| [Q-34](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) | Confirm the unified trust model (D-14, still Proposed) |
| [Q-35](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) | Confirm the [Constitution](HERON_CONSTITUTION.md) — 30 Articles |
| [Q-19](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) | ✅ **Answered 2026-08-28** — Golden Rules 16–21 accepted, and now binding |
| [Q-38](docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md) | The exact install command — needed before going public |
| Copyright | `LICENSE` and `NOTICE` say **Ajmal PS**. Confirm that is right |

---

## 9. Next — Step 6, the first write

⛔ **Phase 0 ends here.** Everything so far is read-only, which is why none of it has needed a permission
gate, a transaction, an undo guarantee or a preview. **Step 6 changes that**, and the safety rules stop
being theory.

Build in this order, as one step — the rails first:

1. **Transaction Safety** — one named `TransactionGroup` per operation, complete rollback on failure
2. **Preview** — *"This will move 247 ducts up 200 mm. 12 are owned by another user and will be skipped."*
3. **Re-count immediately before executing** the accepted preview
4. **Document pinning** by identity
5. **Permission gate in the add-in** — declared risk level per tool
6. **Emergency Stop** in the ribbon
7. Then, and only then: `revit_move_elements`

**Prove it:** *"move them up 200 mm"* → preview → accept → it moves → **one Ctrl+Z puts it back
exactly**. Then force a failure mid-operation and confirm the model is untouched.

**None of that can be proven from mobile.** It can be designed, written and reviewed there; it cannot be
believed until it has run.

Also waiting: `idempotent=False` on every write request — the client already supports it and the reason
is in [§4](#4-the-things-that-will-bite-you) item 8.

---

## 10. How to work on this

- **The owner is a BIM modeller, not a developer.** Explain in BIM terms. He delegates technical choices
  and is right more often than not about product ones — the folder restructure, the metadata standard,
  the toggle button, *"prove it yourself"* and *"study it but take none of its names"* were all his.
- **Do not hand him commands to run when you can run them yourself.** He called that out, fairly.
- **Field evidence beats specification.** The sharpest findings in this repository came from running
  things, not from any document.
- **Say what is untested.** "It builds" is not "it works", and on mobile almost nothing can be more than
  built.
- **Reference material is studied, never copied.** His earlier repositories are read for their
  reasoning; none of their names, dependencies or branding come across.
- **Every number in the docs should be derived, not typed.** The tooling exists; use it.
- Commits are authored **Ajmal PS**. The repo is **private**.

---

*Phase 0 is finished and proven. Everything beyond it is specified, decided, or waiting — and the
documents say honestly which. Where work happens away from Revit, [§6](#6-the-return-to-the-machine-checklist)
is the record of what still owes a test.*
