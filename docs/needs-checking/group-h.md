# Needs checking — Group H

> One group of [the register](../NEEDS-CHECKING.md), in its own file since 2026-09-23 so that it can be read
> alone. **The register's rules, and every group's place in it, are on that page.** A new row
> for this group goes in this file. [`tools/needs-checking-register.py`](../../tools/needs-checking-register.py)
> reads it back into the register for every tool that reads the register, so a row here is seen
> exactly as it was seen there. Written by

## Group H — the lease (needs TWO chats and one Revit)

Changes behaviour proven in Step 1, so it is the group most likely to surprise you.

**Do `A4` first.** The round-trip test already covers the refusal, the `ping`/`info` exemption, the
`inUse`/`mine` reporting and that the first chat is never cut off — all without Revit. What is left here
is only what genuinely needs real Revits and real chats: the picker column, expiry over real time, the
button releasing it, and two Revits not interfering.

| ID | Do this | Pass looks like |
|---|---|---|
| **H1** | One chat, one Revit. Ask anything | Works exactly as before. The lease is claimed silently — you should notice nothing |
| **H2** | Open a **second** Claude chat, connect to the **same** Revit, ask anything | **Refused**, saying the Revit is in use by another chat and roughly when it frees. It must NOT cut the first chat off. *(Mostly covered by `A4` — this confirms it end to end through a real chat)* |
| **H3** | Go back to the **first** chat, ask again | Still works. It never lost its hold |
| **H4** | In the second chat, run `revit_health` | Shows the Revit — `ping`/`info` are lease-exempt, so *looking* must never claim it. *(The exemption itself is covered by `A4`; this checks the tool uses it)* |
| **H5** | Two Revits open, one held by another chat. Ask for the picker | The rows read `(free)` and `(in use by another chat, ~N min left)`. **This is the column that did not exist before** |
| **H6** | Leave the first chat idle over 5 minutes, then ask from the second | Now granted — the lease lapsed. An abandoned chat must not hold a Revit forever |
| **H7** | First chat holding it, press the **Heron button** to disconnect, then ask from the second | Granted immediately. Pressing the button releases it rather than making anyone wait out the timer |
| **H8** | Two chats, **different** Revits (2020 and 2024) | No interference at all. The lease is per process |
| **H9** | `revit_health` from a chat holding **nothing**, with a free Revit open. Then ask from a *second* chat | The second chat is **granted**. A health check must NOT have claimed the free Revit — that bug existed for one commit: it called `count_elements` on every session, which is not lease-exempt |
| **H10** | First chat mid-request, second chat connects and is refused. Watch the FIRST chat | It loses that one reply and recovers on the next. Known limitation, [docs/25](../25-multi-session-and-binding.md): the pipe is displaced at connect, before the lease can speak. If a **write** was in flight it must report the outcome as *unknown*, never as failed |
