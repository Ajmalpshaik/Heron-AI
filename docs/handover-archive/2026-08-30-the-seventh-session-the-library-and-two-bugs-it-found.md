# The seventh session, 2026-08-30 — the library, and two bugs it found

> **Archived session note.** This is a record of work that is finished. It was moved out of
> [`HANDOVER.md`](../HANDOVER.md) on 2026-09-12 so that file could go back to being the short
> live entry point it is supposed to be. Nothing here is specification: where it disagrees with
> [DECISIONS.md](../DECISIONS.md), the [Golden Rules](../14-golden-rules.md) or the
> [Constitution](../../HERON_CONSTITUTION.md), **those win**.

**What it did:** took the fragment library from 7 to **32**, re-authored from the owner's earlier Brain
under [D-25](../DECISIONS.md) — studied and rewritten, never copied, split where a 243-line original
was really two jobs. All 32 compile on all eight releases. All 32 are `DRAFT` ([D-44](../DECISIONS.md)).

**Two real bugs came out of the studying, and they are the same bug wearing different clothes.** Both are
this project's defining failure: **reporting the number that was ASKED FOR as the number that HAPPENED.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **The move path** | Revit's move call returns normally and moves nothing for a pinned element **or a group member**. Heron skipped pinned ones — but *a duct in a group is not pinned*, so it passed the filter and the wrong count reached the answer **and the audit log**. `RevitWrite` now probes positions before and after: **moved / partly / blocked / unverified**. `E10` is the check |
| **The parameter path** | Revit accepts a size, returns **TRUE**, throws nothing, then **snaps** it to the nearest size the type carries — ask a pipe for 77 and it comes out 80. `WRITE_ELEMENT_PARAMETERS` trusted that return value. Its own proof case asked a *human* to check the stored number matched, which the code had no way of knowing |

**The parameter fix is worth reading before writing anything that sets a value.** It needs no string
parsing and no unit handling, because it uses the snap's own timing: *straight after the set the
parameter still reports what was asked for, and the snap happens at REGENERATION.* So read the internal
double, regenerate once for the batch, read it again, compare. Two numbers from the same API in the same
units. `SET_MEP_SIZE` carries the same check for sizes reached by `BuiltInParameter` — deliberately a
second home, because a name lookup for *"Width"* finds nothing on a French install.

**A new tool, and it earned itself on its first run.** Adding a fragment can make an **existing one
unfindable**, silently, and nothing here would have noticed. It had already happened twice.
[`tools/check-routing.py`](../../tools/check-routing.py) asks every fragment its own declared words back to the
search. It found sixteen contested sentences; **three were real errors** — a filter claiming two of
`TRACE_CONNECTIVITY`'s sentences, and an override fragment claiming the grayout **skill's**. Fixing those
took the words route to **100% in the top three**. The other thirteen are genuine English ambiguities and
were left alone.

> **It never fails a build, on purpose.** A collision is a judgement, not a defect. A checker that failed
> here would teach people to weaken their own utterances to buy back a rank — and that is the one
> response ruled out, because taking *"show me just these"* off the isolate fragment would make the
> isolate unfindable in order to protect a number.

**One decision is waiting for the owner at the PC.** `SET_CATEGORY_GRAPHICS` made the grayout skill
wrong: greying every wall one at a time gives the right drawing today and a wrong one tomorrow, because a
wall drawn afterwards keeps its normal graphics and nobody finds out until it prints. The skill now greys
the background **by category**. Whether he wants that, or wants it selection-scoped so he can grey some
walls and not others, is a modelling preference the API does not settle — it is written into
[`brain/skills/mep-grayout.yaml`](../../brain/skills/mep-grayout.yaml) as a decision for him, not a default
someone chose quietly.

**And four tools were found answering when they should have declined** — retrieval printing `nothing
matched` against an **empty store** (indistinguishable from a real miss), searching unknown flags as
text, a structure checker failing purely on **timing** if a compile was running, and a test asserting a
fact about the corpus while its comment claimed it tested the backend. None changed a recorded number.
All four would have corrupted a later one.

> **If you read only one thing:** three walls fell on one day, none of which needed a Windows machine.
>
> **The C# compiles.** Revit 2020 through **2027**, every project, zero warnings — and the Revit-free bridge
> host *runs*, all 32 checks passing including the whole lease. It caught two real defects on its first
> run, both of which reading had already missed twice ([docs/30](../30-compiling-away-from-windows.md)).
>
> **Every open question is answered — 41 of 41**, and **24 decisions** were taken (D-20 to D-43). Nothing
> gates any phase. Several were settled by *looking* rather than deciding: at a system already doing the
> job, and at Heron's own code, where Q-13's answer had been running since Step 1.
>
> **The Constitution is accepted and binding** — all 30 Articles, after Ajmal asked for every one to be
> read out rather than tapping yes. Reading it aloud found three stale statements inside it.
>
> **PHASE 2 STARTED, 2026-08-28.** The owner has **no Revit for about a week** and said so plainly:
> *"checking in Revit is not possible within 1 week, so keep the checking process as a document and
> start Phase 2 — we need to finish that."* [`NEEDS-CHECKING.md`](../NEEDS-CHECKING.md) is now a **record
> rather than a gate**, and [27 — Build Order](../27-build-order.md) carries **Steps 7 to 14**, written
> that day because Phase 2 had never been broken into steps. Seven of the eight need no Revit; only
> Step 14's proof does.
>
> **Step 7 is built and proven-as-far-as-it-can-be**: the fragment's shape on disk, and the validator
> that refuses a proof with no negative case. `python tests/test_fragment_store.py`. The library grew to
> **7** fragments over Steps 9–14; every one is `DRAFT` and **none has met a model** — which is what
> DRAFT means, and why they get no register row.
>
> **Step 8 is built too**: one knowledge store per scope, as one file each. A cross-scope query is
> impossible to *write* — the API takes one scope and `ATTACH` is refused by name, which is the one
> loophole in "one file per scope". Project knowledge with no project identified is **refused, never
> defaulted**, because a wrong guess writes one client's knowledge into another's file.
> `python tests/test_scope_store.py`.
>
> **Step 9 is built**: finding a fragment by exact words, on three routes that name themselves —
> `identity` (one lookup, no search), `cache` (this wording was resolved before), `keywords` (FTS5).
> **Only a `PROVEN` fragment may run off an exact match without asking**, and two fragments claiming one
> sentence is a *miss* rather than a coin toss. It found a real gap in Step 7 on its first run: fragments
> had no `utterances`, so `OST_DuctCurves` matched nothing — [09 §2](../09-skills-and-fragments.md) had
> asked for them and Step 7 had not built them. Now required.
> `python tests/test_search.py`.
>
> **Step 10 is built, and it is the one to read the caveats on.** Embeddings are local, offline and need
> nothing installed — but the built-in backend is **character n-grams, not meaning**, and the tests say
> so in measured numbers rather than in prose: synonyms score **zero or less** (`diffuser`/`grille`
> −0.136), while plurals, word endings and word order all work. The trained backend that *would*
> understand synonyms **has never run**: `huggingface.co` is refused by this container's network, so no
> weights could be fetched. `A7` in the register is that run, and it needs **no Revit and no Windows** —
> any machine with a working network will do.
>
> It also recorded its own successor's acceptance test: on *"show me every duct"* the keyword route
> ranked the right fragment first and the vector route ranked it second, so **Step 11 must fuse them.**
> **That assertion has since been retired, and the reasoning is below** — it held at two fragments and
> stopped at seven, because the sentence is a composition and a composition is what a *skill* names.
> `python tests/test_embed.py`.
>
> **Step 11 is built, and it passed that test at the time — read how, and read what happened to the
> test.** The version filter runs **first, as a wall**: a fragment declared for 2021 is not returned for 2025, proven by making it the best possible
> textual match and watching it stay absent. The two routes are then **fused** rather than chosen
> between, weighted by which embedding backend is running, because Step 10 measured the built-in one as
> not-meaning and an equal vote would over-trust it.
>
> Two of its own claims were wrong and the tests caught both. The quality nudge was **eight times larger
> than one rank of fusion** — it could have jumped a `PROVEN` fragment eight places over better matches,
> which is precisely what its docstring said it could not do. And *"both routes agree"* turns out to mean
> **nothing** while the library is smaller than the retrieval pool: the nearness route ranks every
> eligible fragment, so everything agrees, including a question about cats. The answer now says so in
> its own note. `python tests/test_retrieve.py`.
>
> **Step 12 is built** — the capability registry, and it passes its own acceptance test: a second
> provider is added and **the call site is the same line of code**, then the first is deleted and the
> same line still answers. A capability nobody provides **is** the gap, so there is no second list to
> keep in step.
>
> Its one real design decision: **almost everything is derived rather than stored**, which is
> [D-40](../DECISIONS.md) applied. Risk in particular — it already has two homes (the tool registry
> and each fragment) and a third declaration would guarantee that one day two disagree and nobody knows
> which is true. So a capability's risk is the **highest among its providers**, computed — and providers
> that disagree about it are **reported as a defect**, because a thing that reads and a thing that
> modifies are not two implementations of one capability. A declared value would have hidden exactly
> that. Platform support is an **intersection** for the same reason: a union would claim 2027 because
> one provider manages it, then hand back one that does not. `python tests/test_capability.py`.
>
> **PHASE 2 IS BUILT IN FULL — all eight steps, 7 to 14.** Step 13 is the dependency graph, where every
> edge but one is computed on demand and the deriver was **shown catching a break** before its clean
> answers were believed. Step 14 is ten skills, each naming **capabilities and never fragments**.
>
> **`python tools/check-gaps.py` is the one command to run first now.** It sweeps everything — the build
> order against disk, every test, every checker, every agent id, the library, the registry, the graph,
> the register — and sorts it into **UNFINISHED** and **WAITING**, with the exit code following only the
> first. It now reports **nothing unfinished** and **55 waiting**: 47 need a real Revit, 3 need Windows,
> 1 needs a reachable network, 3 need a conversation with the owner. **It reported nothing unfinished
> until 2026-08-29 for the wrong reason**, when the reachability check was added; that earlier green was
> real about the build order and wrong about the repository. This one was earned by wiring the brain up —
> but read it knowing what the new check asks: whether the seam **exists**, not whether a host has ever
> called through it. That second question is `A8`.
>
> **It found real defects on its first runs, including two in itself.** A scanner that scans itself finds
> itself — it reported its own regex as two undeclared agents. It also caught a second invented agent id
> in as many steps. And growing the library from 2 fragments to 7 exposed a **query bug that was
> invisible at two**: every word was prefix-matched, so `in*`, `me*` and `the*` outvoted the one word in
> the sentence that carried meaning.
>
> **One assertion was retired rather than repaired, and the reasoning matters.** Steps 10 and 11 both
> asserted that *"show me every duct"* must rank the duct **filter** first. That held at two fragments
> and stopped at seven — and the honest reading is not that retrieval got worse, it is that the
> assertion asked the wrong layer. That sentence is filter-**then**-select: a composition, which is what
> a **skill** names. **Next is proof, and it needs the machine.**
>
> **What that did NOT change:** `write.enabled` is still `false` and every parked item is still unproven.
> `R1` — read the day's decisions back — **did not happen before Phase 2 began**, contrary to the
> instruction that asked for it; that was overridden by the owner, which is his to do. **It happened on
> 2026-08-29 instead, and all twenty-one were confirmed with nothing moved** — so the cost of doing it
> late was, on this occasion, nothing measurable. **`A1`, `A2`, `A3` and `A5` are done** — the whole of
> Group A except the Windows named pipe in `A4`, the probe check in `A6`, and `A8`.
>
> Before writing any code, run `python tools/check-compile.py`. It takes minutes, it now covers **all
> eight releases**, and it is no longer somebody else's job. On a fresh Linux box it needs
> `apt-get install -y dotnet-sdk-10.0` first — the .NET 8 package builds only 2020–2024.

> ## ⚠️ READ THIS FIRST — you are probably on a machine with no Revit
>
> The owner is continuing this work **from mobile**, in Claude Code. **There is no Revit there**, and
> there is no Windows, so **nothing in this repository that touches Revit can be tested.**
>
> That does not mean stop. It means **be honest about which half you are in**, and mark every piece of
> Revit-side work as untested until it has met a real Revit on the owner's own machine.
>
> **What still works away from Revit:** [§5](../HANDOVER.md#5-what-you-can-and-cannot-do-without-revit).
> **What must be re-tested on return:** [§6](../HANDOVER.md#6-the-return-to-the-machine-checklist) — keep it up to date.

Then read [docs/README.md](README.md) for the map and
[docs/27-build-order.md](../27-build-order.md) for what to build.
