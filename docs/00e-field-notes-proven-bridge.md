## The short answer

- **Open as many Revits as the PC can handle.** The bridge sets no limit.
- **One chat for one Revit.** This is the only rule that really matters.
- **Mixed versions are fine** — Revit 2020 and Revit 2025 open together, each with its own chat. The
  version makes no difference to the AI.

## Setting it up

1. Open the Revits you want.
2. **In each one, click Connect Heron Bridge** in the Heron pane. A Revit that was never connected does
   not show up at all — it is invisible to every chat.
3. Start a chat for each Revit. When more than one is connected the chat will stop and ask which one to
   use; answer once and it stays on that Revit.

## What happens in each case

| Situation | What happens |
|---|---|
| One Revit connected | Taken automatically. Never asks. Exactly as it always worked. |
| Two or more connected | **Nothing is sent to Revit at all** until you say which one. The AI is not allowed to guess. |
| You have chosen one | Every command in that chat goes there. Opening a third Revit later does **not** ask again. |
| The Revit you chose closes | Everything stops and says so. It never slides onto a different project. |
| Chat A → Revit 1, chat B → Revit 2 | **Works perfectly.** The two never disturb each other. |
| Chat A **and** chat B → the **same** Revit | **They fight.** Whichever speaks last takes the Revit over and cuts the other one off. |

That last row is the reason for the standing rule *"don't go to Revit, another session is running."* It
is not a queue — a second chat does not wait its turn, it pushes the first one out. Nothing is
corrupted, because each chat reconnects on its next call, but a job running mid-way gets chopped.

## Can I keep modelling while the AI works?

**Not in the same Revit — you take turns.** Revit does one thing at a time, and the AI's script runs on
the same thread that draws the screen. While it runs, Revit is genuinely frozen. No add-in can change
that; it is how Revit itself is built.

In practice it barely shows:

- Most jobs finish in **one or two seconds**, with a banner across the top while they run.
- If you are **mid-command** — a wall half-drawn, a dialog open — the AI **cannot interrupt you**. It
  waits until you finish.

**The real danger is not the freeze, it is the stale read:** the AI reads the model, you change
something, and a later step acts on the old picture. That is why every step re-reads instead of
trusting what it saw a minute ago.

**If you want to genuinely work while the AI works, open a second Revit** — your model in one, the AI's
job in the other. Real side-by-side work only exists across two Revits, never inside one.

## Two traps worth knowing

- **The session list shows a stale file name.** When the chat lists the connected Revits, the file name
  shown is whatever was in front when that Revit first connected — it does not update when you switch
  projects. Proven live 2026-08-20. **Identify a session by its number (pid), not by the name shown.**
- **One Revit can hold several projects open.** Picking the Revit is only half of it — commands land on
  whichever project window is in front, and that changes when you click. For anything that *writes*,
  say which project and it gets pinned by name.

## How many is sensible

There is no technical limit, only memory. On this machine (64 GB) **three or four Revits at once is
comfortable**; five works if the models are small. Watch the PC, not a rule.

## Why it works this way

Each Revit hosts its own private line named after its process number, and advertises itself in a
per-process file under the bridge directory — in Heron, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Heron\bridges\<pid>.json`.

Before 2026-08-20 every Revit tried to use one shared line and the second one simply refused to start.
Inside one Revit that line has two slots — one serving the current chat, one already listening — which
is what makes a new chat take over instantly instead of waiting.

# Addendum — Why the "which Revit?" list cannot be trusted

*Second note from the same source, 2026-08-27. Same status: observed, not designed.*

## The list is written once and never updates

When I ask "which Revit?", the list is written once, when you first click Connect. It never updates. So:

**1. The file name in the list can be wrong.** You close BL006A, open BL003A, and the list still says
BL006A. This actually happened on 20 Aug. You'd be picking from a list that lies to you — at exactly the
moment where being wrong is most expensive.

**2. The list doesn't say which Revit another chat is already using.** Nothing shows it. That's why you
have to tell me *"don't go to Revit, another session is running"* — the information exists in Revit, it
is just never written down where I can see it.

## Stop showing process numbers

No more `39344`. When I ask, I'll say:

```text
1) Revit 2024 — Tower A     (free)
2) Revit 2020 — Podium      (in use)
```

You say "1". I handle the rest.

## The freeze is not worth chasing

Making Revit not freeze **can't be done**. Revit runs one thing at a time by design — working around it
needs a whole separate process, and my own code already records that decision as out of scope. Chasing
it would be a lot of work for something that will still break.

**The second-Revit answer is the real one.**
