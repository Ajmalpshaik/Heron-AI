"""
Heron's MCP server - Step 3.

The moment the whole chain exists: a sentence in the AI host, through MCP, down
the named pipe, onto Revit's own thread, and back. Everything after this step
adds capability to a chain that already works, which is a far easier problem
than making the chain exist.

    python mcp/server/heron_mcp_server.py        # speaks MCP over stdio

ONE TOOL, deliberately (docs/27). revit_health answers "is Revit working?" and
nothing else. Selecting by category is Step 4; writing is Step 6 and arrives
with its safety rails.

The answer is written for a person, not for a machine to parse. The host reads
it aloud, so it says what is true and what to do next - never a status code.

NAMING NOTE: this repository has a folder called `mcp/` and the MCP SDK is a
package called `mcp`. They do not collide: a real installed package always wins
over a same-named directory, verified rather than assumed. Do not "fix" this by
renaming the folder.
